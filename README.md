## Introduction

Game designed on Unity in which the player has to scape from the rain of dangerous objects in the factory.
The scripts are written in C# and the graphics are made by Gimp.

The game is based on my father actual job and it's my personal tribute to one of the greatest examples of sacrifice I've ever get to known.

## How To Play

You must avoid the dangerous objects like boxes, pallets and even razors. You have 60 secods in each level to try to survive shower. However, if you keep feeding the player he could be more time on work. Also, there are a few items available that will change the game, in order to make the job easier or even harder. Next, they're detailed:

To move the character, touch any half screen of your device and he will move across your screen. If you touch the same half twice in a very short moment (0.3s), the character will perform a **dash move** and he'll be faster for just one step. Take into account that you'll have to wait five seconds to perform another dash move. The availability is shown you on a green (if it's available) and red bar (it it isn't) on the top left of your screen on game.

The longer you move, the more points you'll get, so try no to stay at the same place for much time.

#### Dangerous Objects

These items substract time from the total life of the character if they touch you. The longer you survive the faster they'll fall from the sky.

- **Box**. It substracts one seconds per touch. It's the slowest one and easy to avoid.
- **Pallet**. It substracts three seconds per touch. If it's rotating, it would be harder not to touch it.
- **Razor**. It substracts five seconds per touch. It's the most dangerous item, so it would be a good idea not even be close to it, but it's also the fastest.

#### Food Objects

These items are made to keep more time on the court. Try to get all of them at the begining of the level, because they'll run out soon and they'll become more unusual as long as you survive. 

- **Orange**. It adds ten seconds per touch.
- **Buterflies Cookies**. It adds five seconds per touch.

#### Power Ups

Any touch with them will change the game. Each one have their own feature. They will fall regularly on the level and they have effect for five seconds.

- **Freeze Icon**. It keeps you cold and during that time you won't move. It's not recommended to touch them.
- **Coffee**. It speeds you up. You could move faster for a moment.
- **Stopwatch**. It makes slower the fall of dangerous objects. The food will fall in the same pace at they were doing before, so it doesn't have any affect on them.
- **Helmet**. It makes the hits don't have any damage on you, so they could touch you with no effect.
- **No Walking Signal**. It makes you hidden from the screen and you'll only could see your own shadow on the ground, but any way the touches will have effect, the good ones and the bad ones, despite you can't see the character.
